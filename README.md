esoreader
=========

A python module for reading *.eso files generated by EnergyPlus

# Introduction

The easiest way to install `esoreader` ist to do:

```
$ pip install esoreader
```

# Features

- parse `*.eso` files to pandas `DataFrame`s
- search for output variables by substring

# Installation


# Using esoreader with Pandas

```python
In [1]: import pandas as pd

In [2]: import esoreader

eso = esoreader.read_from_path(r'/PATH/TO/OUTPUT/eplusout.eso')

In [5]: eso.find_variable('heating')
Out[5]:
[('TimeStep', None, 'Heating:EnergyTransfer'),
 ('TimeStep',
  'DEFAULT_ZONEZONEHVAC:IDEALLOADSAIRSYSTEM',
  'Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Heating Energy')]
```


# Using esoreader without pandas

The eso files generated by EnergyPlus contains a data dictionary, which
describes the values reported by EnergyPlus. The list of values reported
depends on the simulation input file, specifically the `Output:Variable` and
`Output:Meter` objects.  EnergyPlus can output the same variable at different
frequencies and for different "keys", which are for instance surfaces or
equipment names.

Following the data dictionary is a list of output variable values for each of the configured
variable coordinates.

The output of the esoreader module is therefore a data dictionary object that contains
a mapping of variable "coordinates" (grouping of reporting frequency, key and variable name)
to the index used by EnergyPlus and a data object, which essentially just maps that index to
the timeseries data.

## Example

```python
import esoreader

PATH_TO_ESO = r'/Path/To/EnergyPlus/Output/eplusout.eso'
dd, data = esoreader.read(PATH_TO_ESO)
frequency, key, variable = dd.find_variable('Zone Ventilation Total Heat Loss Energy')[0]
idx = dd.index[frequency, key, variable]
time_series = data[idx]
```
